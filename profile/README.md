### Modern principles of learning
Our Founder has been the Capability Development Lead for large multinational organizations. He has been in the field of training-at-workplace for more than 20 years now. The past experience of developing the learning assets and more has gone into the development of all the courses. The courses have been made to be effortful, contextual, engaging, interactive and with real-life projects. The capability development process deployed is the possibly the most rigorous and has been created with the view of making the passouts ready to meet and exceed the expectations of the Delivery and Project Managers working on global Blockchain projects.

### Coding skills
Our latest National Education Policy has emphasized the need for coding skills across the spectrum of learning. Our courses are focussed on enabling the most basic coding skills. Our courses DO NOT need any previous coding experience. We inculcate the basic coding skills needed for the Participant. Also, one of the key differentiators is that we are launching our first course on Blockchain in Hindi along with English. This will ensure the vast rural reach for our country and be a strong step in the direction of increasing employment in the rural youth. We also plan to have our course in regional languages as well.

### Standard delivery of Education
The courses are delivered using the blended approach. This means that we will have online as well as live delivery classes. The online component will be delivered through videos. This ensures a standard content delivery approach to all the students. This also ensures that the content itself is also comprehensive and is standard across all sessions.

### Highly scalable delivery model
We are using servers which will be scalable with minimal to zero development work for increasing the bandwidth of delivery. This means that even if the number of students taking courses increases to a large number, we will be able to ramp our infrastructure within a very short period of time, if not within a few hours.

### Affordable
Most equivalent technical professional courses cost way higher. Our cost of courses is the lowest in the market. The objective of the courses is to make it affordable, amongst others, for rural markets as well. We also qualify to be signed up with a variety of Education loan companies. This will make the courses within the reach of almost everyone, including those earning close to minimum wage levels.
